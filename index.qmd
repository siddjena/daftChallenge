## The Scurvy Story: A Data Science Tragedy

Scurvy was a devastating disease that affected sailors on long voyages. The cure was discovered in 1747, but due to a misunderstanding about the cause, the cure was lost for over 150 years. The story involves three different understandings of the data generating process:

1. **1747 Understanding:** Lemons prevent scurvy (correct but incomplete!)
2. **Misguided Belief:** Acid kills bacteria that causes scurvy (wrong!)
3. **1928 Understanding:** Vitamin C prevents scurvy (the real mechanism)

### DAG 1: The 1747 Understanding (Correct but Incomplete)

**Historical Context:** In 1747, James Lind discovered that lemons prevent scurvy through a controlled experiment. However, the understanding was incomplete - they knew lemons worked but not why.



```{python}
#| label: dag-1-1747
#| echo: false

import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize the DAFT figure
pgm = daft.PGM(shape=[4, 2], origin=[0, 0], grid_unit=2.5)

# Add nodes
pgm.add_node("lemons", "Lemons / Citrus", 1, 1.0, 
 scale=2.0,
             aspect=1.7, plot_params={"ec": "#2E7D32", "fc": "#FFFFE0", "lw": 2})
pgm.add_node("scurvy", "Scurvy Prevention", 3, 1.0, 
 scale=2.0,
             aspect=1.8, plot_params={"ec": "#1565C0", "fc": "#90CAF9", "lw": 2})

# Add edge: Lemons → Scurvy Prevention
pgm.add_edge("lemons", "scurvy", directed=True, lw=2.5, color="#424242")

# Add title using matplotlib
pgm.render()


# Display the DAG
plt.show()
```

### DAG 2: The Misguided Belief (Wrong Understanding)

**Historical Context:** Over time, people came to believe it was the acid in lemons that killed bacteria which was causing scurvy. This led to lemons being replaced by limes (cheaper but less Vitamin C) or just using acids like vinegar, causing scurvy to return.



```{python}
#| echo: false

import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize DAFT figure with extended x-axis
pgm = daft.PGM(shape=[8, 2], origin=[0, 0], grid_unit=2.0)

# Add nodes with evenly spaced visual positioning
pgm.add_node("acid", "Acid", 0.8, 1.0,
             scale=1.8, aspect=1.2,
             plot_params={"ec": "#B71C1C", "fc": "#FFCDD2", "lw": 2.5})
pgm.add_node("bacteria", "Bacteria Death", 2.8, 1.0,
             scale=1.8, aspect=1.8,
             plot_params={"ec": "#E65100", "fc": "#FFFF99", "lw": 2.5})
pgm.add_node("scurvy", "Scurvy Prevention", 4.8, 1.0,
             scale=1.8, aspect=2.0,
             plot_params={"ec": "#9E9E9E", "fc": "#E0E0E0", "lw": 2.5})

# Add arrows (edges)
pgm.add_edge("acid", "bacteria", lw=2.3, color="#BF360C")
pgm.add_edge("bacteria", "scurvy", lw=2.3, color="#616161")

# Render and make layout compact
pgm.render()

# Add title and styling

plt.show()
```

### DAG 3: The 1928 Understanding (Complete and Correct)

**Historical Context:** In 1928, the true mechanism was discovered - it was Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that prevented scurvy. This complete understanding finally explained why lemons worked and why the acid theory was wrong.


```{python}
#| label: dag-3-1928
#| echo: false

import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize the DAFT figure with wider layout for 3 nodes
pgm = daft.PGM(shape=[6, 2], origin=[0, 0], grid_unit=2.0)

# Add nodes with improved scientific color progression
# Orange → Pink → Green: Nutrient → Biological Process → Health Outcome
pgm.add_node("vitamin_c", "Vitamin C", 1, 1.0, 
             scale=2.0,
             aspect=1.7, plot_params={"ec": "#E65100", "fc": "#FFE0B2", "lw": 3})
pgm.add_node("collagen", "Collagen\nSynthesis", 3, 1.0, 
             scale=2.0,
             aspect=1.5, plot_params={"ec": "#C2185B", "fc": "#F8BBD9", "lw": 3})
pgm.add_node("scurvy", "Scurvy Prevention", 5, 1.0, 
             scale=2.0,
             aspect=1.8, plot_params={"ec": "#2E7D32", "fc": "#C8E6C9", "lw": 3})

# Add edges with complementary teal color for scientific flow
pgm.add_edge("vitamin_c", "collagen", directed=True, lw=3.0, color="#00695C")
pgm.add_edge("collagen", "scurvy", directed=True, lw=3.0, color="#00695C")

# Add title using matplotlib
pgm.render()


# Display the DAG
plt.show()
```
